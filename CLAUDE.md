# Review agents — model selection
Applies to **any code review or PR review** (`/pr-review`, `/code-review`, or an ad-hoc "review this
code/PR" request). Run the review analysis in the **`code-reviewer`** subagent (via the Agent tool)
so it executes on its own model boundary and keeps the main session model free for orchestration.
Choose the subagent's model from how I phrase the request:
- **Default** (no model mentioned) → omit the `model` param; it falls to the agent's `sonnet` frontmatter.
- **"advanced" agents** (e.g. "usa agent avanzati") → pass the **current session model explicitly**
  (the family shown in your system prompt's "You are powered by …" line: opus | sonnet | haiku | fable).
- **"agent {model}"** (e.g. "agent opus", "agent haiku", "agent sonnet", "agent fable") → pass that
  exact model.
Best-effort for direct `/code-review`: that skill loads inline into the main thread, so honor this by
delegating its analysis to the `code-reviewer` subagent rather than reviewing inline.
